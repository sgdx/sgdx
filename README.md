Execute following steps to work with smart contract on Etherscan 
- Go to Etherscan and find a contract. Paste contract address to Search Box and press enter. 
- Click on "View Dapp Page" icon. It is on the second table in the first row. Looks like pencil ( a bit ;))

connect your Metamask to Ropsten network.*
